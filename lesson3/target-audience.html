<h3>
    What is the weather in the areas around (specific place)?
</h3>
<p>
    The visitors that are going to travel should know how the weather is in the areas around where they want to go to see at what time they should leave or if they can go to do the activity that they want to. They heard that is going to snow in some of the
    areas around the place they want to go, and they don't want to go if it's going to snow or rain there.
</p>
<h3>
    How are the road after rain?
</h3>
<p>
    It will give an indicator to see if they need more time to travel or if it's safe. The couple that is going don't like mud and don't want to get dirty.
</p>
<h3>
    There is going to be a storm in the next two weeks?
</h3>
<p>
    There is a group form high school, they learned to drive a couple of months ago and don't have experience driving with snow, they want to go camping but do not want to freeze.
