        Salt Lake City Temple
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Salt Lake Temple is a structure of granite and it was built over a period of 40 years. It was dedicated on April 6, 1893. In the conference held on April, 2019, President Nelson announced that the Salt Lake Temple would be close on December 29, 2019
        for apporximately four years, so they can do some renovation and restoration to the temple. <br> Temples are the most sacred place for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a place where we make covenants with
        God and have the opportunity to do the ordinances for ourselves and for people that is already in the other side of hte veil. <br> We belive that families can be together forever through sealings, a very special and sacred ordinance that can only
        be performed in the temple. If you want to learn more about temples and ordincances <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples?lang=eng"> visit this website</a>
